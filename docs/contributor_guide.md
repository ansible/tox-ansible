# Contributor Guide

To contribute to `tox-ansible`, please use pull requests on a branch of your own fork.

After [creating your fork on GitHub], you can do:

```shell-session
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:your-name/tox-ansible
$ cd tox-ansible
$ git checkout -b your-branch-name
# DO SOME CODING HERE
$ git add your new files
$ git commit -v
$ git push origin your-branch-name
```

You will then be able to create a pull request from your commit.

Prerequisites:

1. All fixes to core functionality (i.e. anything except docs or examples) should
   be accompanied by tests that fail prior to your change and succeed afterwards.

2. Before sending a PR, make sure that `tox -e lint` passes.

Feel free to raise issues in the repo if you feel unable to contribute a code
fix.
